1. I set up the library needed to run the game and installed dependencies.
2. To remove the black flashlight that appears when the game is first opened, I first reviewed the main code to find the code related to it.
I found the draw_black_screen_effect() function in the mainMenu.py file and removed it.

3. This took some time.
I first identified a problem with the functions used to determine the location of the tank, the ground, and the explosion. The related function was update_after_explosion. During debugging, I discovered that the logic for checking whether the explosion area included the ground point was incorrect, resulting in the remaining simple pixels being displayed.
Therefore, I modified the original logic and wrote an evaluation function. This, combined with a ceiling function, resolved the issue of the single pixel being displayed after the change.

4. This was not completed. The problem was to split the shot into four shots at the apex, applying different impact points and hitting only 1/4 of the shots. I set up a three-step process: splitting the shot into four shots at the apex, finding the different impact points, and writing a script to apply only 1/4 of the shots.
First, I confirmed that the shot should be split into four shots at the apex, and the apex finding process was accurate.
Then, I tried to split the shot into four shots, but the angle calculations were complex and couldn't be completed within the allotted time.
To briefly explain the logic, I defined a function that sets offsets for the horizontal and vertical velocities relative to the apex of the shot and loops to find shots in the four directions for each shot.
This function calculates the direction and velocity of the four split shots and their impact points.
