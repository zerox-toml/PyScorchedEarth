This is a no-AI exercise. Please do not use LLM engines, or AI code completion.

This is your starting point:

Your task is to do following:

1. Get the game to work with newest versions of respective libraries pygame 2.6.1, shapely 2.1.2, numpy 2.2.6
2. Label as FIX1 : remove bug / annnoying feature of flashlight effect on all-dark menu at the start
3. Label as FIX2 : fix a single pixel of terrain remanining in an explosion crater
4. Label as FEAT1 : add MIRV shot type - a shot will split into four shots on top of its ballistic trajectory, each shot should impact in a different spot with an explosion and damage 1/4th of a single shot

Please keep notes of your engineering decisions in a .md file in the repository
